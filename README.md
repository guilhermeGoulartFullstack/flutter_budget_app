# flutter_budget_app

The goal was to create a in-house app where the staff can register the customer's ("Cliente") license plate, the services ("Serviços") that the mechanic's shop provides. Then, in the budgets ("Orçamentos") page, a new budget can be created, selecting the client and the services already registred in the app. After that, the staff can rapidly share the full budget with the client via an "share button" to every social media possible, providing details like the all the services planed to be done, total value, the overall description and others.

The app was builded to real use, that's the reason that it's in Portuguese. The objective is to, over time, improve every aspect of it, including more features, better design and UX, fixing any potential bugs. 

Developed using only Flutter\Dart, with tools like MobX and GetX and uses the Firebase Firestore to retain all data provided.
